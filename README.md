# TXT-Edit
A lightweight solution to creating .txt files on Mac.

Basically it lets you save a .txt file and then opens TextEdit to actually edit it. This lets you be able to still have an option to make rich text documents through TextEdit, but also be able to easily create .txt files without having to go through the settings and have to choose between plaintext or richtext.

Unfortunately I'm a little bit poor at the moment so the .app is unsigned and will not work but the python script works fine.
